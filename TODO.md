# TODO file for Snowman

While the core should be functional, there's still a lot to do.

## Library

- [ ] Fix TODOs and "Not implemented" in code.
- [ ] Improve API and modernize code
- [ ] Performance improvements (memory allocation!)
- [ ] Modernize model file format (Protobuf?)
- [ ] Prebuilds for common plattforms?

## Other

- [ ] Provide Website/API for hotword training (for non-technical users)
- [ ] Allow training with more than 3 samples
- [ ] Allow training with false positives

## Outlook
- [ ] Maybe implement speaker ID since we already do most of the work required for it?
