# TODOs

While the core should be functional, theres still a lot to do.

### Library

- [ ] Fix TODOs and "Not implemented" in code.
- [ ] Improve API and modernize code
- [ ] Performance improvements (Memory allocation!)
- [ ] Modernize model fileformat (Protobuf ?)
- [ ] Prebuilds for common plattforms ?

### Other

- [ ] Provide Website/API for hotword training (for non technical users)
- [ ] Allow training with more than 3 samples
- [ ] Allow training with false positives

### Outlook
- [ ] Maybe implement speaker ID since we already do most of the work required for it ?
